# Sofka U: Object and classes handling in Java

This is the first of many assignments presented in the *SofkaU Software Development Course* and it consists in a little exercise in which 6 different classes are created, each one with its own attributes and methods.


# Assignment breakdown

Here you will find 7 different files: 6 files corresponding to 6 different classes and 1 "main" class mostly used for testing that each class was created correctly.

Each class contains an object. Public, private and protected attributes and methods are created across all classes.

The "main" class can be used to test the creation of objects using the other classes. For example: `Computer test = new Computer();`will create a new Computer object and `test.setLoginInfo("demo", "demo1");` will make use of one of this class's methods.
